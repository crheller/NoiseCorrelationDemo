Simple app to explore how different pairwise correlation structure affects optimal linear decoding of two signals.

To run the app, install bokeh using conda: `conda install bokeh`. Also make sure to have `sklearn` installed in your python environment as well.

Then, navigate to the main directory: (`/NoiseCorrelationDemo/`) in a terminal and run: `bokeh serve --show NoiseCorrelationDemo.py`
