# NoiseCorrelationDemo
Simple web app to explore how different pairwise correlation structure affects optimal linear decoding of two signals.

To run the app, install bokeh using conda. Then, navigate to the root directory (`../NoiseCorrelationDemo/`) in
a terminal and run: bokeh serve --show NoiseCorrelationDemo.py
